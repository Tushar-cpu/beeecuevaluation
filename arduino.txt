AIM-Design a dice that displays a 
          (A.)Red background when 6 comes up.
          (B.)Green background when 4 comes up.
          (C.)Blue background when 2 comes up.

MATERIALS REQUIRED-
          1. Arduino
          2. Breadboard
          3. Led(RGB) 
          4. Connecting wires
       
CONCEPT-
         Kirchhoff's law:
                 kirchhoff's law are fundamental to circuit theory.they quantify how current flows through a circuit and how voltage varies 
                 around a loop in a circuit.
                   1.) kirchhoff's first law-it states that current flowing into a node must be equal to current flowing out of it.this is a
                         consequence of charge conservation.
                   2.)kirchhoff's second law-it states that the sum of all voltages around any closed loop in a circuit must equal to zero. 
                        this is a consequence of charge conservation and also conservation of energy.

LEARNING OUTCOMES-
                    1.)Red led will glow when 6 comes.
                    2.)Green led will glow when 4 comes.
                    3.)Blue led will glow when 2 comes.

PRECAUTIONS-
                    1.)connecting wires should be tight.
                    2.)LED's should work properly.
                    3.)Arduino and Breadboard should be properly working
